# UoL SoiCS Freshers 2020 Orientation Week - 5th - 9th October 2020

## Student Engagement

This repo is a development area for the student engagement SoCS orientation week (5th - 9th Oct 2020) materials 

## Note

This project is nothing directly to do with the UoL SU and is a separate set of activities to compliment and help new starters make new friends and feel comfortable with the SoCS as quickly as possible. Currently, these activities are timetabled around 15:00-18:00 after the main events and can be found on student timetables.

These events were made by students for students and hope to demonstrate how welcome, open and inclusive the school is.
